This code is for a parking management thing. Parking sensors upload
their status to dweet where a central device monitors this and updates the
display accordingly. The real time money made and sensor values are then relayed to dweet which
is accessed by a website hosted on the dweet that displays this info.

Steps for launch:
1. The sensors should be connected first. Ensure each sensor connets to local
network. If any errors occur with network retry. 
2. Power up Pi and ensure apache web server is running. Run the processes.py with python3. 
3. At this point everything should function together. The website updates on refresh. Refresh needs
1sec between accesses to dweet to not cause an error.
